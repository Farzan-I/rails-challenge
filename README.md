Tanda & Workforce.com Code Challenges
=================================

Welcome to our Code Challenges! If you've been sent this link, it's because we are keen to see your programming or design skills in action. (If you've stumbled across this repo, we're also keen to see your skills in action - have a go at a challenges!)

Each challenge will have more information about how to complete it, and how to submit when you're done. If you get stuck at
any stage, please ask! If you've been chatting to someone from our team, email them back, otherwise just send an email to developers@tanda.co
and we'll be happy to help you out.

By the way, if you find any bugs or things you think could be improved in these challenges, make a pull request :)

## Why does this exist?

Most companies ask you to email them a resume. We think resumes are dumb. Rather than telling us what you can do, we think it's best to show us what you can do! We also want to see that you can [apply, not just remember](https://blog.testdome.com/blooms-taxonomy/). These challenges are an easy way to do both.
